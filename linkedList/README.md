# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type and has many methods so you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list

user have a Linked List and we want to create methods to :
add item at the end of the list
// input:  integer
//output LinkedList
give 2 value first one it's the value I want to add the value before it and the second one it's the value
â€ƒ//input: two integer value
   //output LinkedList
give 2 value first one it's the value I want to add the value after it and the second one it's the value
 //input: two integer value
 //output LinkedList

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Make a Node class and linked list class that includes 3 methodes ansert, includes and toString
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I started with make a node class then the linked list and finally test the code

### O()

| **Method**| **Time complixty** | **space complixty** |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| insert|O(1)|O(1)|
| includes| O(n)|O(1)|
| toString |O(n) |O(n)|
| kth | o(n) | O(1)
| zip | o(n) | O(n)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
* insert that take an integer and add it to linked list
* includes that take an integer and return boolean if it is in array return true if not false
* toString that return a string contain all object value
